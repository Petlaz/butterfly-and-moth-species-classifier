• **Developed an end-to-end deep learning pipeline** to classify 100 different butterfly and moth species with 13,500+ labeled images using computer vision techniques and transfer learning

• **Implemented transfer learning with EfficientNetB4** as the backbone architecture, achieving robust classification performance through feature extraction and fine-tuning strategies

• **Engineered comprehensive data preprocessing pipeline** including image normalization (224x224 RGB), data augmentation (rotation, flips, brightness adjustments), and implemented class balancing techniques for imbalanced dataset handling

• **Built production-ready model architecture** with GlobalAveragePooling2D, dropout regularization (0.5), and softmax classification layer, optimized using Adam optimizer with adaptive learning rate scheduling

• **Applied advanced training techniques** including early stopping, learning rate reduction on plateau, model checkpointing, and two-phase training (frozen base model followed by fine-tuning with 1e-5 learning rate)

• **Conducted thorough model evaluation** using macro-averaged precision, recall, F1-score metrics and confusion matrix analysis to assess per-species classification performance across 100 classes

• **Developed interactive prediction functions** for single and batch image classification with confidence scoring and top-N predictions visualization for model interpretability

• **Implemented robust data handling** with train/validation/test splits (12,594/500/500 images), categorical encoding, and TensorFlow data pipelines for efficient batch processing

• **Created comprehensive visualization tools** for exploratory data analysis, class distribution analysis, training curves monitoring, and prediction results with confidence intervals

• **Applied MLOps best practices** including model versioning, automated checkpointing, systematic hyperparameter tuning, and reproducible experimental workflows in Jupyter notebooks
